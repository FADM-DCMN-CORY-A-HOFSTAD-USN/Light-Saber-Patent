## Vibroblade
The length of a plasma projection is equal to the length of the focus of the hue emitter. The Distance to the Focus must coordinate with frequency hops emmitted by the weapon emmiter.

The Hue Emitter outputs high power power light from the ultraviolet to infared spectrum. The ultraviolet light freezes any atoms within the focus. The infrared light melts anything within the focus.

The weapon emitter is a microwave which is brodcast at a frequency which matches resonance to the length of the hue focus.
